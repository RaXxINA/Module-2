		    <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat. Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered, and the wings are short.[17] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[18] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[17] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[19]

Chickens are omnivores.[20] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[21] and young mice.[22] A chicken may live for 5â€“10 years, depending on the breed.[23] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[24]

Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. Individual chickens dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and nest sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the "pecking order".[25][26] Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts.[27] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young fox.[28]

Crowing (with audio)
A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other males,[29] and in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and to call their chicks. Chickens give different warning calls to indicate that a predator is approaching from the air or on the ground.[30]</p>
